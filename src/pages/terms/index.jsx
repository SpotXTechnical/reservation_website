        By accessing the App and using it, you are accepting the Terms of Use,
        as indicated below, and agree to abide by them. These are the terms on
        which SpotX allows you to access and use the App. If you do not agree to
        these Terms of Use, then you are not permitted to use the App. SpotX
        reserves the right to deny access to any user who do not abide by the
        Terms of Use stated below.

      <ul className={styles.terms_content}>
        <li>
          By entering the App, the user accepts these terms and conditions and
          agrees to abide by them
        </li>
        <li>
          SpotX is not obliged to make available any number or type of services
          to the second party. The first party is free to determine the type,
          timing and conditions of use of the various services it offers. This
          agreement outlines the terms and conditions whereby the second party
          is allowed to access and use the App and its services, whether as a
          visitor or a registered user. Therefore, please read these Terms of
          Use carefully before you start using the App.
        </li>
        <li>
          Leases are concluded exclusively between the user providing the
          accommodation (“Host”) and the user renting the accommodation
          (“Tenant”) or the (“Guest”). SpotX itself is not a party to the leases
          or contracts concluded between the App’s users. The Hosts and the
          Tenants are themselves responsible for satisfying their own
          contractual obligations. In the event of default, this must be
          negotiated between the users. SpotX saves and will transmit the
          contact data of both parties for this purpose.
        </li>
        <li>
          SpotX does not examine the legality, accuracy or completeness of
          properties or content listed on the App; however, SpotX is entitled to
          verify any information including personal, legal and tax information
          of the users and ask for the corresponding proofs. SpotX reserves the
          right to deny access to users who refuse to provide such information
          when requested.
        </li>
        <li>
          By using the App, the user confirms that he complies with public law
          regulations, particularly those for payment, factoring and tax law
          obligations, which may also include any obligations under sales tax
          law or indirect tax obligations. The Host will be solely responsible
          for his obligations and duties under the applicable tax laws. SpotX is
          not obligated and will not intervene in anyway to make tax payments or
          to calculate the applicable taxes on or to perform any tax related
          activities on behalf of the Host or the Guest unless it decides to do
          so at its own discretion.
        </li>
        <li>
          Hosts can apply their own house rules, terms and conditions to the
          accommodation they are renting as long as it does not affect or
          conflict with the General Terms and Conditions of SpotX.
        </li>
        <li>
          The User shall not allow another person or entity to use his User
          account. The User will achieve that by protecting his username and
          password. The User will be held accountable if any information is
          leaked through his account. In case this happens against his will or
          by error, the user has the responsibility to inform SpotX immediately.
        </li>
        <li>
          SpotX is entitled to terminate access to the App for any User with or
          without giving any reasons and with or without prior notice. This will
          especially apply in cases where the information provided by the
          subscriber upon registration is misleading and/or incorrect, or when a
          User publishes content that is misleading, harms others, sexual or
          violent in nature, or conflicts with public morality. The second party
          does not have the right to repudiate the first party`s decision and/or
          compel the first party to retract its decision.
        </li>
        <li>
          SpotX does not assume any responsibility for any of the content
          published on the App or sent through it or linked to it. The content
          can not be taken for granted and/or relied upon in any way. If a User
          uses the service for any illegal or unlawful purposes, the User will
          be held accountable for this unlawful use, without any liability to
          the first party.
        </li>
        <li>
          SpotX will mediate when necessary between users, and has the final say
          in all disputes.
        </li>
        <li>
          The first party shall maintain the confidentiality of the data of the
          second party. Please review Our Privacy Policy.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some of the Services offered by the App are free and some are offered
          for a fee. SpotX reserves the right to charge a fee for services
          currently offered for free in the future, as it sees fit, and the user
          will have the right to accept or reject such services.
        </li>
        <li>
          By posting a sponsored ad, you accept the App site’s “fair”
          methodology of allocating premium Ads, with the reservation that fair
          does not mean equal. We aim to Increase the probability of premium Ads
          views per average user. Increasing the probability does not mean
          appearing to all users, and the user has the right to refuse or accept
          this service.
        </li>
        <li>
          SpotX is entitled to communicate with users to inform them of any news
          or additional services or suggestions or to transmit advertising
          material, as it deems appropriate, through written or audible or
          visible or interactive materials and/or instructions on its pages or
          via e-mail or via sms or through social-media Apps (such as Facebook,
          Twitter, etc...), or as it sees fit. The broadcast of these materials
          will be evidence that the user is aware of them.
        </li>
        <li>
          The first party or one of its affiliates shall thereby provide the
          necessary technical support for Users abiding by the terms of this
          agreement.
        </li>
        <li>
          The App does not guarantee the continuity of the service or that it
          will be provided without interruption, or that the service will be
          error-free or provided in a timely manner. The App does not guarantee
          the desired or expected results from the use of its services, and will
          not be held liable to the user or any entity for any consequences of
          using or not using its services.
        </li>
        <li>
          The user is not entitled to use the trademarks and logos of SpotX in
          any personal or commercial transactions without the permission of
          SpotX.
        </li>
        <li>
          SpotX will not be held liable for any transactions that occur via the
          App. The App will not be responsible in the event of non-completion of
          a transaction or for the quality of the underlying property or for the
          nature of the transaction or for other factors that are related to the
          transaction or stems from it. The responsibility and the risk of using
          the App lies with the User as the App is provided without warranty and
          is provided on an “as is, as available” basis. Therefore, under these
          Terms of Use, SpotX denies any liability or responsibility for, and
          without limitation, direct, indirect, special, punitive, incidental or
          consequential loss or damage incurred by any user in connection with
          the App or in connection with the use, inability to use, or results of
          the use of the App, any Apps linked to it and any materials posted on
          it. Caveat emptor principle applies.
        </li>
        <li>
          SpotX reserves the right to amend the terms of this agreement without
          prior notice.
        </li>
        <li>
          SpotX does not endorse any Member, Listing or Host Services. Any
          references to a Member being &quot; verified &quot; (or similar language) only
          indicate that the Member has completed a relevant verification or
          identification process and nothing else. Any such description is not
          an endorsement, certification or guarantee by SpotX about any Member,
          including of the Member`s identity or background or whether the Member
          is trustworthy, safe or suitable. You should always exercise due
          diligence and care when deciding whether to stay in an Accommodation
          or use other Host Services, accept a booking request from a Guest, or
          communicate and interact with other Members, whether online or in
          person.
        </li>

        <li>
          Hosts and Tenants are responsible for their adherence to the
          provisions governed by public law, including municipal codes regarding
          property rental.

          When you register as a member by filling out the registration

          User obligations, user account, system integrity
        </p>
        <li>
          The Host is responsible for ensuring that the accommodation he offers
          is described accurately, correctly and completely. He must provide the
          information in SpotX`s required fields at a minimum so that the
          accommodation and the offer are described with sufficient accuracy.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Host is free to stipulate further conditions such as the amount of
          any deposit, the cost of final cleaning, cancellation options, etc...
          The various cancellation policies that can be agreed are available
          under cancellation policies.
        </li>
        <li>
          The user is liable to SpotX for all actions performed using his user
          account, unless the user is not responsible for the misuse of his user
          account.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the user is aware that third parties have access to his user data
          or have otherwise gained access to his user account, he must notify
          SpotX of this immediately. SpotX is entitled to then block the user
          account until the situation has been clarified.
        </li>
        <li>
          Brokers, agents and/or any other person(s) and/or representatives
          acting on behalf of the Property Owner(s) must have the legal capacity
          / standing to do so. SpotX is not responsible for verifying such legal
          capacity / standing. SpotX will only proceed to remove the property
          from the platform and block the user account once notified by the
          Property Owner about any potential misuse or unauthorized use of the
          property. SpotX will cooperate with the Property Owner on best effort
          basis and will provide him with all the available information;
          however, SpotX will not be in anycase obliged to do so and will do so
          only at its sole discretion.
        </li>
        <li>
          Each user must independently verify the identity of his respective
          contract partner. SpotX does not accept any liability for the accuracy
          of the user contact or personal information entered on the platform.
        </li>
        <li>
          The user undertakes to set up his systems and programmes in connection
          with the use of SpotX offering in a way that ensures that the
          security, integrity and availability of systems set up by SpotX to
          provide its services are not affected.
        </li>
        <li>
          Users must not use addresses, contact data, or e-mail addresses that
          they obtain by using the App for any purpose other than for
          contractual communication. In particular, these data must not be
          forwarded to unauthorised persons or used to send advertising, unless
          the user in question has expressly granted his consent in advance.
        </li>
        <li>
          The user absolutely must not send mass messages with the same content
          via SpotX. Any spamming or similarly harassing action towards other
          users or third parties is prohibited and the user might be permanently
          banned as a consequence.
        </li>
        <li>
          Each user is himself responsible for archiving any information that is
          received when making a transaction for the purposes of preservation of
          evidence, accounting, taxes, etc. on a storage medium independent of
          SpotX. SpotX is not responsible for availing or for record keeping
          such information.
        </li>

        <p className={styles.sub_title}>Handling of content and rights</p>
        <li>
          SpotX saves for the user the multimedia content uploaded by him
          (images, text, etc...). It merely arranges the necessary memory space
          and access to it. Users themselves are therefore solely responsible
          for the content they upload to SpotX and indemnify SpotX against all
          third-party claims resulting from this. This indemnification also
          includes the costs incurred for the purposes of prosecution and legal
          defense and any other incidental costs that are incurred.
        </li>
        <li>
          You give SpotX for free the non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual,
          irrevocable, royalty-free, sub-licensable right to use, copy,
          reproduce, distribute, display, modify or create derivative works of
          the Content perpetually and for any purpose SpotX sees appropriate.
          The User warrants that the holder of any rights, including moral
          rights in such Content, has completely and effectively waived all such
          rights and irrevocably gave the User the right to grant the license,
          or distribute or advertise or use or transmit such content.
        </li>
        <li>
          The content offered via SpotX is protected by copyright. The platform
          is generally accessed and utilised individually by a natural person
          using a web browser. The use of technologies such as web spiders,
          crawlers, or similar programmes, the purpose of which is not just the
          indexing of content but also the mass accessing and saving of the
          platform`s content is prohibited. This also applies in particular to
          technologies that enable so-called screen scraping and other
          third-party services.
        </li>
        <li>
          The App offers online electronic and interactive services, and the
          second party uses it at their own will. SpotX is generally accessed
          and utilised individually by a natural person using a web browser, a
          mobile device, a tablet, or any other similar devices. The use of
          technologies such as web spiders, crawlers, or similar programmes, for
          purposes other than just indexing the App`s content is prohibited. The
          mass accessing and saving of the SpotX`s content is strictly not
          allowed. This also applies to technologies such as screen scraping.
        </li>
        <li>
          User agrees that the App and the company that manages it (or its
          subsidiaries or affiliates, as appropriate) are the owners or the
          entity authorized to use all intellectual property rights of content
          posted on this App, and that the App itself is a collective work
          and/or compilation solely owned by SpotX. The App enjoys protection of
          copyright laws and treaties around the world. You may not copy,

          allowed to reverse engineer the code or try to discover it in another
          way.

        <p className={styles.sub_title}>Dispute Resolution</p>

        <li>
          SpotX may mediate to resolve disputes between Users only at its only
          discretion; however, SpotX is not obliged to do so.
        </li>
        <li>
          While SpotX may help facilitate the resolution of disputes, SpotX has
          no control over and does not guarantee:

          Availability and amendment of the App
        </p>
        <li>
          The service is available to all people from all parts of the world
          without any discrimination on the basis of nationality, gender,
          religion or race.
        </li>
        <li>
          The user has no legal claim to permanent use of the platform. In
          particular, SpotX is not required to ensure that the platform is
          available or can be reached at all times. However, SpotX endeavours to
          maintain operation of the platform with as few disruptions as possible
          and to continue to develop it in line with user requirements.
        </li>
        <li>
          SpotX can temporarily restrict use if this is necessary in terms of
          security, integrity, capacity limits, or the performance of technical
          measures (maintenance work).
        </li>
        <p className={styles.sub_title}>Liability for third-party sites</p>
        <li>
          The platform`s pages also include links to Apps on the Internet
          maintained by third parties, the content of which is not known to
          SpotX. SpotX merely provides access to the Apps and accepts no
          responsibility for the content. The links to third-party Internet
          sites merely serve to facilitate navigation. SpotX does not endorse
          the views expressed on the sites to which it links, and rather hereby
          expressly distances itself from all content on all Apps that it links
          to on its platform.
        </li>
        <li>
          SpotX is not responsible for third-party offerings or content. The
          owners of third party content or Internet sites to which SpotX links
          to are solely responsible for both their content and for the goods or
          services that they offer.
        </li>
        <li>
          By posting your listing on SpotX, you also agree that your property`s
          data will be shared and viewed on third party Apps and/or applications
          with which SpotX has an agreement with. In any case, SpotX is not
          responsible for any booking made via a third party App and/or
          application and these bookings will be concluded solely at the Host`s
          discretion. The Host will be notified that this is a booking from a
          third party.
        </li>
        <p className={styles.sub_title}>Booking process, payment, invoicing</p>
        <li>
          By listing an accommodation on SpotX, the Host is issuing an
          invitation to submit offers. Another user can submit an offer to
          conclude a lease for this accommodation. The agreement arises if the
          Host accepts this offer within 24 hours in a manner intended by SpotX.
          Otherwise, the other user is no longer bound to his offer.
        </li>
        <li>
          You understand that a confirmed booking of an Accommodation
          (“Booking”) is a limited license granted to you by the Host to enter,
          occupy and use the Accommodation for the duration of your stay, during
          which time the Host (only where and to the extent permitted by
          applicable law) retains the right to re-enter the Accommodation, in
          accordance with your agreement with the Host.
        </li>
        <li>
          You agree to leave the Accommodation no later than the checkout time
          that the Host specifies in the Listing or such other time as mutually
          agreed upon between you and the Host. If the checkout time is not
          specified by Host, the checkout time will be 10:00 AM by default. If
          you stay past the agreed upon checkout time without the Host`s consent
          (“Overstay”), you no longer have a license to stay in the
          Accommodation and the Host is entitled to make you leave in a manner
          consistent with applicable law. In addition, you agree to pay, if
          requested by the Host, for each twenty-four (24) hour period (or any
          portion thereof) that you Overstay, an additional nightly fee of up to
          two (2) times the average nightly Listing Fee originally paid by you
          to cover the inconvenience suffered by the Host, plus all applicable
          Guest Fees, Taxes, and any legal expenses incurred by the Host to make
          you leave (collectively, &quot; Overstay Fees &quot;). Overstay Fees for late
          checkouts on the checkout date that do not impact upcoming bookings
          may be limited to the additional costs incurred by the Host as a
          result of such Overstay. A Security Deposit, if required by a Host,
          may be applied to any Overstay Fees due for a Guest`s Overstay.

        <li>
          Cancellations are considered to be withdrawals before the planned
          check-in. One of the options shown under Cancellation Policies can be
          agreed. Refunds required as a result will be paid by the Host to the
          Guest after deducting any applicable cancellation fees and any cost
          incurred in making the refunds.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Host must ensure that:
          <ul>
            <li>
              the description of the accommodation and the images used do not
              violate the law or third-party rights and that they relate only to
              the accommodation on offer.
            </li>
            <li>successfully booked accommodation is indicated accordingly.</li>
            <li>
              information uploaded does not constitute references to third-party
              content.
            </li>
            <li>
              he complies with public law regulations, particularly those for
              payment, factoring and tax law obligations, which may also include
              any obligations under sales tax law or indirect tax obligations.
              The Host will be solely responsible of the obligations and duties
              of the offer content. SpotX is entitled to verify whether Hosts
              are fulfilling their tax obligations or not.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          The payment process shall take place under the following provisions:
          <ul>
            <li>
              The agreement arises by way of a total price shown at the end of
              the booking. This consists of the rent, the service fee and any
              other fees demanded by the Host such as cleaning fees. The fees
              comprise of an administration component and a property-based
              component.. After a booking has been made, SpotX notifies users of
              its content and the total price.
            </li>
            <li>
              SpotX is entitled to change the amount of service fees at any
              time. This does not apply to leases already concluded.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Tenant must pay the total price shown in the booking to the
              Host by way of the channel he agreed with the Host. This
              especially applies to payments via Cash Collection and Bank
              Deposit.
            </li>
            <li>
              In case the Guest wants to raise a dispute or hold the payment,
              instructions to SpotX must be sent immediately using the contact
              form in the Contact Us page stating grounds and/or rationale for
              doing so.
            </li>
            <li>
              If use of the accommodation is not transferred to the Tenant as
              per contractual arrangement, the Tenant has the right to a full
              refund.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          The Host reserves the right to additionally charge other on-site costs
          based on consumption and use (in particular: electricity, water,
          heating). The Host must advise the Tenant that he has a basic right to
          charge these costs before concluding the agreement. Such costs are not
          taken into account in the calculation of the service fee. This also
          applies to any security deposit
        </li>
        <p className={styles.sub_title}>Security Deposit</p>
        <li>
          The Host is entitled to charge a security deposit in his offer. If a
          Host demands a security deposit from the Tenant on the day of arrival,
          corresponding information on the amount of the security deposit and
          the payment method must have already been mentioned in the offer
          and/or the property description. The amount of the security deposit
          must be stipulated prior to the booking. It must also be clarified in
          advance when the amount must be paid.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the Host did not mention the security deposit when advertising his
          accommodation, but demands a security deposit at a later time and the
          Tenant does not agree, this constitutes a refusal to render
          performance by the Host under the agreed contract. In such cases,
          SpotX reserves the right to cancel the booking and to charge the Host
          a cancellation fee.
        </li>
        <li>
          SpotX is not responsible for the administration of security deposits
          or for any claims asserted by the Host.
        </li>

        <p className={styles.sub_title}>Review system</p>
        <li>
          The App allows users to review each other after the conclusion of the
          transaction. Reviews are intended to provide meaningful information on
          users trustworthiness. The reviews are not reviewed in advance by
          SpotX.
        </li>
        <li>
          Users undertake to make only truthful statements in the reviews they
          submit and to comply with the corresponding legal provisions. The
          reviews expressed by users must not violate third-party rights, in
          particular personality rights. They must be objective and must not
          contain defamatory criticism.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any use of the review system contrary to the purpose of the review
          system is prohibited. In particular, users are prohibited from issuing
          reviews about themselves or arranging for third parties to let
          information be known in reviews that is unrelated to the settlement of
          the underlying agreement, and are prohibited from using reviews for
          any purpose other than presentation on the App.
        </li>
        <li>
          SpotX does not intervene in the review system without justifiable
          grounds. Reviews issued will be neither amended nor removed by SpotX
          unless SpotX is legally and specifically required to do so. Reviews
          cannot be altered after they have been posted. They are saved
          permanently in a user`s reviews profile and can be viewed by all
          users. SpotX is entitled to add notes to a review if this is useful
          for clarification and a better understanding of the review in
          question. The only case where SpotX will publish a review in place of
          a user is if the Host has cancelled a booking, in which case an
          automatic one-star review will be published on the offer.
        </li>

        <li>
          If reviews are abused by a user, SpotX shall have the right to remove
          the review as an exception and to take the measures stated in section
          12. This applies in particular if:
          <ul>
            <li>
              the review must be removed on account of an enforceable court
              ruling against those who issued the review.
            </li>
            <li>
              the comment contains remarks that are vulgar, obscene, racist, not
              suitable for minors, sexual in nature or criminally offensive.
            </li>
            <li>
              the review contains another member`s personal information, such as
              name, address, telephone number or e-mail address
            </li>
            <li>the review contains unauthorised links or scripts</li>
            <li>
              if a user has inadvertently posted a negative review for the wrong
              user, but has already corrected this error and assigned the same
              review to the correct user.
            </li>
            <li>
              the review was issued by a person who was not authorised to make
              the booking.
            </li>
            <li>
              the review comes from a user whose user account was blocked by
              SpotX within 90 days of registration. This does not apply to user
              accounts that are blocked for non-payment of a service fee or in
              situations where users are granted the opportunity to solve the
              problem and the user account is restored.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          If both users agree, a review that has already been issued can be
          withdrawn. The review point will be removed and will no longer be
          included in the reviews profile.
        </li>

        <p className={styles.sub_title}>Duration, termination</p>

        <li>
          This Agreement shall be effective for an indefinite amount of time
          until such time when you or SpotX terminate the Agreement in
          accordance with this provision.
        </li>
        <li>
          You may terminate this Agreement at any time via the &quot; Delete Account &quot;
          feature in the User Account on the SpotX platform. If you cancel your
          SpotX Account as a Host, any confirmed booking(s) will be
          automatically cancelled and your Guests will receive a full refund. If
          you cancel your SpotX Account as a Guest, any confirmed booking(s)
          will be automatically cancelled and any refund will depend upon the
          terms of the Listing`s cancellation policy.
        </li>
        <li>
          Without limiting our rights specified below, SpotX may terminate this
          Agreement with or without prior notice.
        </li>
        <li>
          SpotX may immediately, without notice terminate this Agreement if (i)
          you have materially breached your obligations under these Terms, the
          Payments Terms, our Policies or Standards, (ii) you have violated
          applicable laws, regulations or third party rights, or (iii) SpotX
          believes in good faith that such action is reasonably necessary to
          protect the personal safety or property of SpotX, its Members, or
          third parties (for example in the case of fraudulent behavior of a
          Member).
        </li>
        <li>
          In addition, SpotX may take any of the following measures (i) to
          comply with applicable law, or the order or request of a court, law
          enforcement or other administrative agency or governmental body, or if
          (ii) you have breached these Terms, the Payments Terms, our Policies
          or Standards, applicable laws, regulations, or third party rights,
          (iii) you have provided inaccurate, fraudulent, outdated or incomplete
          information during the SpotX Account registration, Listing process or
          thereafter, (iv) you and/or your Listings or Host Services at any time
          fail to meet any applicable quality or eligibility criteria, (v) you
          have repeatedly received poor Ratings or Reviews or SpotX otherwise
          becomes aware of or has received complaints about your performance or
          conduct, (vi) you have repeatedly cancelled confirmed bookings or
          failed to respond to booking requests without a valid reason, or (vii)
          SpotX believes in good faith that such action is reasonably necessary
          to protect the personal safety or property of SpotX, its Members, or
          third parties, or to prevent fraud or other illegal activity:
          <ul>
            <li>
              refuse to surface, delete or delay any Listings, Ratings, Reviews,
              or other Member Content.
            </li>
            <li>cancel any pending or confirmed bookings.</li>
            <li>limit your access to or use of the SpotX Platform.</li>
            <li>
              temporarily or permanently revoke any special status associated
              with your SpotX Account.
            </li>
            <li>
              temporarily or in case of severe or repeated offenses permanently
              suspend your SpotX Account.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          In case of non-material breaches and where appropriate, you will be
          given notice of any intended measure by SpotX and an opportunity to
          resolve the issue to SpotX`s reasonable satisfaction.
        </li>
        <li>
          If we take any of the measures described above (i) we may refund your
          Guests in full for any and all confirmed bookings that have been
          cancelled, irrespective of preexisting cancellation policies, and (ii)
          you will not be entitled to any compensation for pending or confirmed
          bookings that were cancelled.
        </li>
        <li>
          When this Agreement has been terminated, you are not entitled to a
          restoration of your SpotX Account or any of your Member Content. If
          your access to or use of the SpotX Platform has been limited or your
          SpotX Account has been suspended or this Agreement has been terminated
          by us, you may not register a new SpotX Account or access and use the
          SpotX Platform through an SpotX Account of another Member.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you or we terminate this Agreement, the clauses of these Terms that
          reasonably should survive termination of the Agreement will remain in
          effect.

          Measures in the event of illegal conduct and/or conduct in breach of
          contract by the user
        </p>
        <li>
          SpotX is entitled to terminate access to the App for any User with or
          without giving any reasons and with or without prior notice. This will
          especially apply in cases where the User is violating legal
          provisions, third party rights or when the information provided by the
          subscriber upon registration is misleading and/or incorrect, or when a
          User publishes content that is misleading, harms others, sexual or
          violent in nature, or conflicts with public morality. The second party
          does not have the right to repudiate the first party`s decision and/or
          compel the first party to retract its decision.
        </li>
        <li>
          In case SpotX determines that a user is in breach of its Terms &
          Conditions and/or is not acting in good faith, SpotX can contest and
          cancel existing leases in the name of the Host without taking into
          account the otherwise applicable cancellation policies, and reject the
          user`s offers for the conclusion of a lease in the name of the Host.
        </li>
        <li>
          Leases that have already been concluded between the user and other
          users are not affected by deletion of a property. This applies
          accordingly to claims for the payment of service fees already due. An
          effective lease does not arise if SpotX deletes an offer before it is
          accepted by a user.
        </li>
        <li>
          SpotX reserves the right to block a user, taking the legitimate
          interests of the users into account, if the user has repeatedly
          received negative reviews.
        </li>

        <p className={styles.sub_title}>SpotXs Liabiltiy</p>
        <li>
          As SpotX does not participate in the contractual relationship between
          the Tenant and the Host, SpotX accepts no liability for contracts for
          accommodation.
        </li>
        <li>
          SpotX is not liable for refunding the Guest or the Host their service
          fees in situations where SpotX is not at fault or when SpotX is acting
          within it`s terms, conditions and policies.
